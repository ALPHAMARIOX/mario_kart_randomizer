# Mario Kart Randomizer
Basic command line tool that randomizes characters, vehicles, parts, etc. Code can be used for web pages or GUIs if it's compatible with Python 3.

This set of tools includes randomizers for:

- Super Mario Kart
- Mario Kart 64
- Mario Kart Super Circuit
- Mario Kart Double Dash
- Mario Kart DS
- Mario Kart Wii
- Mario Kart 7
- Mario Kart 8
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

Feel free to implement them in more GUI based or web based generators.

To use in console type `python filename.py`
Once in the programs, press `Enter` to randomize and type `n` to quit. In the Mario Kart Wii Randomizer, type `b` for randomizing Battle Mode, including character, vehicle and mode.
